HTML Tag Count

I did HTML tag counter from domain with python.
To scrape a HTML file from a certain web page, I used a python library caleld Beautiful soup 4.
It works with parser to provide navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
Then with using Beautiful soup again, I pull the data I wanted from that HTML.
Finally, I printed with json file format.
